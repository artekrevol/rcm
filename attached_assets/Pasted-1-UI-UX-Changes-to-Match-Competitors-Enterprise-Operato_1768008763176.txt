1) UI/UX Changes to Match Competitors (Enterprise Operator Console)
Change A — Make List/Table the default everywhere (not Kanban)

Competitors default to worklists (tables) with filters, not boards.

Leads: replace default board with “Worklist”

UI changes

Add View toggle: Worklist | Board

Default = Worklist

Board remains optional

Worklist columns (exact)

Lead (name + phone)

Status

Priority

Next Action

Last Outcome

Attempts

VOB Completeness (0–100)

Insurance (carrier + plan type)

LOC / Service Needed

Owner

Created

UX behavior

Row click opens Lead Detail

Hover shows quick actions: Call, Text, Assign, Mark Qualified, Mark Lost

Change B — Add Work Queues (tabs) like Waystar/Experian “work queues”

Top of Leads and Claims add queue tabs.

Leads Queues

SLA Breach (P0)

New → Not Contacted

Incomplete VOB

VOB Complete → Needs Admissions

Needs Follow-up Today

Claims Queues

Blocked (P0)

At Risk (P1)

Stuck > X days

Ready to Submit

Need Prior Auth

These are just saved filters. Huge perceived value, minimal build.

Change C — Turn the Lead Detail into a “summary-first” record like competitors

Competitors don’t make you read transcripts first.

Lead Detail Layout (top-down)

Header strip with:

Status, Priority, Owner, Next Action, Next Action At

Summary cards row

Intake Completeness (%)

Insurance Snapshot

VOB Status

“Auth Likely?” flag

Action panel (right rail)

Mark as Contacted/Qualified

Request missing info (email/SMS stub ok)

Create claim packet

Add note

Transcript/Call logs below, collapsed by default

Change D — Add “Reason + Next Step” everywhere (the #1 competitor pattern)

Competitors always show “why” and “what now”.

Claims List add 2 columns:

Reason (Auth Likely, Missing Info, Coding Risk)

Next Step (Obtain Auth, Verify Benefits, Fix CPT)

Rules List add “Impact” that is real:

Triggers (30d)

Prevented

$ Protected

2) Replit Build Instructions (Step-by-Step)

I’m assuming your stack is:

React + TS + Tailwind + shadcn

Express + Postgres + Drizzle

TanStack Query

If any mismatch, still follow structure.

Step 1 — Add required fields to the DB (Leads)
1.1 Update Drizzle schema

File: server/db/schema/leads.ts (or wherever leads schema lives)

Add these fields (exact):

priority (text) default 'P2'

nextAction (text) nullable

nextActionAt (timestamp) nullable

lastOutcome (text) nullable

attemptCount (int) default 0

vobStatus (text) default 'not_started'

vobScore (int) default 0

carrier (text) nullable

memberId (text) nullable

planType (text) nullable

serviceNeeded (text) nullable

ownerUserId (uuid) nullable

handoffStatus (text) default 'not_sent'

Enums (use text if you want speed)

priority: P0, P1, P2

vobStatus: not_started, in_progress, verified, incomplete

handoffStatus: not_sent, sent, accepted

1.2 Add indexes (important for worklists)

Add indexes for:

(status, priority, createdAt)

(priority, nextActionAt)

(ownerUserId, status)

1.3 Generate migration and push

Create migration

Run migration

Seed 30–50 leads with realistic values across statuses

Acceptance

You can query leads and see new fields populated.

Step 2 — Create “Worklist API” endpoints
2.1 Leads worklist endpoint

File: server/routes/leads.ts

Create route:

GET /api/leads/worklist

Query params

queue (string) e.g., sla_breach, incomplete_vob

status optional

owner optional

q optional search text

page, pageSize

Server-side logic

Apply queue filters (see Step 3)

Return:

rows

countsByQueue (for tabs)

total

Acceptance

Postman / browser returns rows + queue counts.

Step 3 — Implement Queue Logic (this is the ROI brain)

Create a helper:
File: server/services/queueFilters.ts

Leads Queue Definitions (exact)

sla_breach (P0)
status in ('new','attempting_contact') AND created_at >= now()-24h AND last_contacted_at is null AND created_at <= now()-60min

not_contacted
status='new' AND attempt_count=0

incomplete_vob
vob_score < 100 OR carrier is null OR member_id is null OR plan_type is null

vob_complete_needs_admissions (P0)
vob_status='verified' AND handoff_status='not_sent'

follow_up_today
next_action_at <= end_of_today AND status not in ('converted','lost')

Claims Queue Definitions (if needed this week)

blocked readiness='blocked'

at_risk readiness='at_risk'

stuck days_since_last_event > threshold

Acceptance

Tabs match what the team expects operationally.

Step 4 — Build Leads Worklist UI (replace Kanban default)
4.1 Add view toggle + persist selection

File: client/pages/Leads.tsx

Create a toggle component:

“Worklist” (default)

“Board”

Store in localStorage: leadsView = 'worklist' | 'board'

4.2 Work Queue tabs

At top of the page, add tabs with counts:

SLA Breach

Not Contacted

Incomplete VOB

VOB Complete → Needs Admissions

Follow-up Today

When tab changes:

call /api/leads/worklist?queue=<tab>

4.3 Implement Worklist table component

File: client/components/leads/LeadsWorklistTable.tsx

Use shadcn table pattern.

Rows render

Priority badge (P0 red, P1 amber, P2 neutral)

VOB score as progress chip (0/25/50/75/100)

Next Action as pill

Hover quick actions

4.4 Quick actions (row hover)

Assign

Mark Contacted

Mark Qualified

Mark Lost

Open

These should call PATCH endpoints (Step 5)

Acceptance

You can run the client and operate the leads like a call center console.

Step 5 — Add “Operator Actions” endpoints (PATCH)
5.1 Leads patch route

File: server/routes/leads.ts

Add:

PATCH /api/leads/:id

Allowed updates:

status

priority

nextAction / nextActionAt

vobStatus / vobScore

carrier / memberId / planType / serviceNeeded

ownerUserId

handoffStatus

Acceptance

Quick actions update UI instantly (optimistic update is a plus).

Step 6 — Upgrade Lead Detail UI (summary-first + right rail)
6.1 Header strip

File: client/pages/LeadDetail.tsx

Add top strip:

Status pill

Priority pill

Owner dropdown

Next Action + datetime picker

Buttons: “Mark Qualified”, “Mark Lost”

6.2 Summary cards row

Add 4 cards:

Intake Completeness (use vobScore)

Insurance Snapshot (carrier/plan/memberId)

VOB Status

Auth Likely (stub logic ok: if serviceNeeded in detox/residential => likely)

6.3 Right rail actions

Add stacked buttons:

Update Insurance Info (opens modal)

Mark VOB Verified

Create Claim Packet

Add Note

6.4 Transcript collapsible default closed

Move transcript into accordion collapsed by default.

Acceptance

Lead Detail feels like Salesforce/Waystar record: summary + actions first.

Step 7 — Claims list improvements (Reason + Next Step)

File: client/pages/Claims.tsx

Add 2 columns:

Reason (top risk driver / block reason)

Next Step (mapped action)

Backend can return these as computed fields or simple string fields.

Acceptance

Claims list tells an operator “what to do” without clicking in.

Step 8 — Rules page: make Impact real (the “wow” metric)
8.1 DB fields for rule impact (fast approach)

If you don’t have event-based tracking yet, implement quick metrics from claims:

preventedCount = number of claims blocked by rule

$protected = sum of claim.amount blocked by rule

triggeredCount = number of claims matched by rule condition (even if not blocked)

Return those to UI.

8.2 UI change

Replace Impact column blanks with:

“23 prevented”

“$47,500 protected”

“41 triggers”

Acceptance

Rules page now looks like a revenue system.

3) UI Styling Notes to Match Competitors (Do these in parallel)

Competitors use:

denser tables

less empty space

more right-rail actions

more badges and inline status

Apply these UI changes globally

Reduce card padding slightly (p-6 → p-4)

Reduce row height in tables (dense mode)

Make filters sticky (top bar stays while scrolling)

Use consistent status colors across the app:

P0/Blocked: red

P1/At Risk: amber

Ready/Verified: green

Replace large gauges with:

progress bars

labeled risk drivers

This moves you from “nice demo UI” → “enterprise ops UI.”

4) What to Ship by End of Week (Minimum “Client WOW” Bundle)

If you ship only these, it’s still a win:

Leads Worklist (default) + Queue tabs

Quick actions + PATCH updates

Lead Detail summary-first + action rail

Claims list Reason + Next Step

Rules Impact ($ protected) populated

That bundle demonstrates clear ROI:

faster intake throughput

fewer missing data issues

fewer blocked claims

operational clarity
