Perfect — this is already **80% of a top-tier RCM product**. To get **client-visible ROI this week**, we need to **tighten the Leads system into an execution engine**, not add new modules.

Below are **Replit-ready instructions ONLY** (backend + frontend), focused on **what to build/change**, **why it increases ROI**, and **how to align UI/UX with competitors like Waystar / Cedar / AKASA / Olive without overbuilding**.

---

# 🔥 THIS WEEK’S ROI GOAL (FOR THE CLIENT)

**Primary KPI this week**

> ⬆️ Increase % of leads that reach **VOB Complete** within 24–48 hours

**Secondary KPIs**

* ↓ Time to first contact
* ↓ Incomplete VOB backlog
* ↑ Conversion → Claim Creation
* ↑ Staff efficiency per intake rep

Everything below maps directly to those.

---

# PRIORITY 1 (THIS WEEK): TURN LEADS INTO A REAL WORK QUEUE

Right now your Leads page is visually strong but **passive**.

Competitors win because:

* The UI *forces action*
* The system *tells staff what to do next*
* Managers can *see leaks instantly*

We’ll fix that **without adding new infra**.

---

## 1️⃣ BACKEND: LEAD EXECUTION MODEL (CRITICAL)

### A. Add Required Fields (DB / Drizzle)

Update `leads` table:

```ts
next_action_type: enum(
  'call',
  'callback',
  'verify_insurance',
  'request_docs',
  'create_claim',
  'none'
)

next_action_due_at: timestamp (nullable)

last_contact_at: timestamp (nullable)

sla_deadline_at: timestamp (nullable)

outcome_code: enum(
  'no_answer',
  'left_voicemail',
  'contacted',
  'qualified',
  'unqualified',
  'insurance_missing',
  'wrong_number'
)

vob_missing_fields: jsonb
// example: ["member_id", "payer", "dob"]
```

**Why this matters**

* Competitors don’t just store leads — they store **decisions**
* This unlocks SLA tracking, urgency, automation, and manager oversight

---

### B. SLA AUTO-ASSIGNMENT (HIGH ROI)

On lead creation:

```ts
if (priority === 'P0') {
  sla_deadline_at = now() + 1 hour
} else if (priority === 'P1') {
  sla_deadline_at = now() + 4 hours
} else {
  sla_deadline_at = now() + 24 hours
}
```

**ROI**

* Clients immediately see “we reduced response time”
* This is a **Waystar-level expectation**

---

## 2️⃣ FRONTEND: LEADS TABLE — WHAT TO CHANGE (VERY SPECIFIC)

### A. Make “Next Action” the STAR COLUMN

#### Change:

* Move **Next Action** to column #3 (after Status)
* Show as **action badge**, not text

Example badges:

* 🔴 `CALL NOW`
* 🟠 `VERIFY INSURANCE`
* 🟡 `CALLBACK @ 3PM`
* 🟢 `READY FOR CLAIM`

**Implementation**

```tsx
<Badge variant={
  nextAction === 'call' ? 'destructive' :
  nextAction === 'verify_insurance' ? 'warning' :
  'success'
}>
```

**ROI**

* Intake reps stop scanning rows
* They just execute the queue
* This is exactly how Cedar & AKASA drive speed

---

### B. VOB SCORE → VOB COMPLETENESS (LANGUAGE MATTERS)

#### Change:

Rename **VOB Score** → **VOB Completeness**

Show:

* Progress bar
* Tooltip listing missing items

```tsx
Tooltip:
"Missing: Member ID, Payer, DOB"
```

**Competitor insight**

* No one in ops cares about “scores”
* They care about “what’s missing”

---

### C. SLA BREACH = VISUAL PAIN

For rows where `now > sla_deadline_at`:

* Add **red left border**
* Auto-promote Priority to `P0`
* Add clock icon in Lead column

```css
border-left: 3px solid #ef4444;
```

**ROI**

* Managers instantly see breakdowns
* This is a **client demo killer feature**

---

### D. ATTEMPTS → CLICKABLE TIMELINE (LIGHTWEIGHT)

Instead of `Attempts = 2`, make it clickable:

On click → modal:

```
Jan 9, 2:13 PM – No answer
Jan 9, 11:02 AM – Voicemail left
```

**No new backend needed** — derive from call logs.

---

## 3️⃣ WORK QUEUES: MAKE THEM INTELLIGENT (NOT FILTERS)

### A. SLA Breach Queue (P0)

Auto logic:

```ts
where now() > sla_deadline_at
and status != 'Converted'
```

UI:

* Show **count in red**
* Lock this tab to first position

---

### B. Incomplete VOB Queue (MOST ROI)

Logic:

```ts
where vob_completeness < 100
and status in ('Contacted', 'Qualified')
```

Add **Missing Fields column** (compact pills):

* `DOB`
* `Member ID`
* `Payer`

**ROI**

* This directly reduces denials later
* This is the *core pitch* of ClaimShield

---

## 4️⃣ LEAD DETAIL PAGE (SUMMARY-FIRST — TIGHTEN IT)

### A. Header Strip — ADD 1 THING

Add:

> **“Claim Risk Preview”** badge

* GREEN / YELLOW / RED
* Based on current data completeness

This creates:

> Mental link between **intake quality → revenue**

---

### B. Summary Cards — CHANGE ORDER

Current → OK
**Change to:**

1. **Next Action (with due time)**
2. **VOB Completeness**
3. **Attempts / Last Contact**
4. **Last Outcome**

This mirrors **Waystar’s intake panels**.

---

### C. One-Click Conversion (HIGH WOW)

Add button:

> **“Create Claim (Pre-Filled)”**

Rules:

* Enabled only if VOB = 100%
* Pull payer, CPT, patient info automatically

**ROI**

* Client sees instant downstream value
* Reduces manual re-entry

---

## 5️⃣ MANAGER VISIBILITY (VERY IMPORTANT FOR BUYERS)

Add **1 lightweight manager metric** (no new page):

At top of Leads page:

```
⚠️ 7 leads breaching SLA
🟡 12 incomplete VOBs
🟢 18 ready for claim
```

These numbers should be **clickable filters**.

---

# UI/UX ALIGNMENT WITH COMPETITORS (NO REDESIGN)

### What competitors do visually:

| Area         | Competitor Pattern | What You Should Do              |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Density      | Dense tables       | Keep yours (already good)       |
| Color        | Status-driven      | Increase red/orange usage       |
| Action       | Always visible     | Surface Next Action             |
| Language     | Operational        | Rename “Score” → “Completeness” |
| Manager view | KPI first          | Add SLA & backlog counts        |

You are already **90% there visually** — this is about **behavioral UX**, not styling.

---

# WHAT NOT TO BUILD THIS WEEK ❌

* New AI models
* New dashboards
* Clearinghouse integrations
* More charts

They don’t move **client ROI in 7 days**.
