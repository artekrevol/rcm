You are a senior frontend engineer + rebranding specialist. Apply a full brand rename and UI theming update across the entire app.

GOAL
- Replace ALL branding references from any previous name (including “ClaimShield”) to:
  PRIMARY BRAND NAME (public): "Claim Shield Health"
  SHORT NAME (UI where space is tight): "Claim Shield"
  APP ID/slug (code-safe): "claim-shield-health"

CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (DO NOT VIOLATE)
- Do NOT use the single-string “ClaimShield” anywhere in UI copy, titles, meta tags, emails, or visible content.
- Use “Claim Shield Health” as the primary visible identity.
- Avoid medical cross iconography as a standalone symbol in UI (it can imply regulated medical branding). If a cross exists in the logo, treat it as abstract geometry only; do not emphasize it in UI elements.

ASSETS
- Ensure these brand assets exist at:
  /public/brand/logo_full.png
  /public/brand/logo_icon.png
  /public/brand/favicon_square.png
  /public/brand/favicon_circle.png
  /public/brand/favicon_blue.png

If any are missing, create placeholders by copying existing logo assets and naming them exactly as above.

BRAND TOKENS (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
1) Implement global design tokens used everywhere.
- Colors (use CSS vars + Tailwind/theme integration if present):
  --csh-blue: #1F7AE0
  --csh-teal: #22C6B6
  --csh-slate: #2F3A45
  --csh-bg: #FFFFFF
  --csh-bg-soft: #F6FAFC
  --csh-border: rgba(47,58,69,0.12)
  --csh-focus: rgba(31,122,224,0.35)
- Gradient:
  --csh-gradient: linear-gradient(180deg, #1F7AE0 0%, #22C6B6 100%)
- Typography:
  Font: Inter preferred (fallback to system sans)
  Headings: 600, Body: 400–500
- Radii:
  10 / 14 / 18 px (sm/md/lg)
- Shadow:
  0 6px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08)

2) Apply tokens globally via:
- Tailwind theme config if Tailwind exists, otherwise:
- globals.css + shared token exports.

LOGO + WORDMARK REPLACEMENT (EVERYWHERE)
Replace brand visuals in:
- Navbar header (desktop + mobile)
- Sidebar (collapsed + expanded)
- Login/signup screens
- Settings/profile areas
- Any splash/loading or empty state visuals
- Footer and marketing/landing pages

Rules:
- Desktop header: logo_full.png at 140–170px width.
- Sidebar collapsed: logo_icon.png at 28–32px.
- Sidebar expanded: logo_full.png at 120–150px.
- Logo always links to "/" (home/dashboard).
- Maintain consistent padding 12–16px around the logo.

FAVICON + META
Update browser/app metadata:
- Document title: "Claim Shield Health"
- Meta description (neutral): "Secure, streamlined claims workflow software."
- Theme color meta: #1F7AE0
- Favicon: use /public/brand/favicon_circle.png
- Apple touch icon: use /public/brand/favicon_square.png
- Update manifest if present (name, short_name, icons).

UI COMPONENT THEMING (CONSISTENT LOOK)
Buttons:
- Primary: background var(--csh-blue), hover darken 8%, active darken 12%, text white
- Secondary: white background, border var(--csh-border), text var(--csh-slate)
- Accent CTA: gradient var(--csh-gradient) (max 1 per page)
Inputs:
- Border var(--csh-border)
- Focus ring 2px var(--csh-focus)
Cards:
- Background white, border subtle, radius md
Tables:
- Header background var(--csh-bg-soft)
- Row hover rgba(31,122,224,0.06)

COPY UPDATES (TEXT)
- Replace every occurrence of:
  "ClaimShield" => "Claim Shield Health" (or "Claim Shield" when space is limited)
- Replace any old app name in:
  headers, titles, auth screens, emails/templates, footer, settings, onboarding, empty states, help text.
- Do NOT add medical claims. Keep compliant, operational language only:
  Examples:
  - “Verify. Protect. Resolve.” (optional tagline)
  - “Claims workflow, simplified.”
  - “Secure verification for faster resolution.”

ADD A BRAND QA PAGE (FAST VERIFICATION)
Create route: /brand-preview
Show:
- logo_full + logo_icon
- Color swatches (blue, teal, slate, bg-soft)
- Buttons (primary/secondary/accent)
- Inputs (default + focus)
- Card + table sample
- Typography scale (H1/H2/body/caption)
This page is for visual QA only; do not link publicly in production if not desired.

SEARCH + CLEANUP (MUST DO)
- Search repo for: "ClaimShield", "claimshield", old hex codes, old logo filenames.
- Remove or replace all occurrences.
- Ensure no broken paths.
- Ensure responsive layout.

DELIVERABLE OUTPUT
When finished, provide:
1) A list of files changed
2) Summary of what was updated (logos, meta, theme, copy)
3) How to verify: visit /brand-preview and key pages (login, dashboard, settings)

DO NOT change business logic. Branding + UI only.
